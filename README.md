# CLJ Runner

A simple way to 'click to run' clojure script with deps.edn local deps cache.

> Just work on Windows now, need JVM install and Clojure CLI (or babashka) Configured.

Generally speaking, in order to accomplish a certain task, you need to create a Clojure project in IDEA or VSCode - maybe Lein or deps.edn manage the dependencies. When development is done, you need to package uberjar and create a script: `.bat` for Windows or `.sh` script for Linux to execute `java -jar clojure.main YOUR-SCRIPT` or `clojure -M -m YOUR-SCRIPT`, which is pretty tedious -- if you want to configure something, you will have to use one more edn file, which you then read in the Clojure script - now you have four things: `YOUR-SCRIPT.clj`, `YOUR-CONFIG.edn`, `YOUR-DEPS-ALL.jar` and `YOUR-RUNNABLE.bat`, which is unnecessary for most tasks.

Since Clojure scripts are generally used to complete the daily low-frequency developer work, assuming that the developer has installed the JVM and clojure CLI (basically necessary), then only one `YOUR-ONLY-SCRIPT.clj` script + `clj-runner` is needed. configure Windows to double-click to open the `.clj` file to run `clj-runner.exe`, you donâ€™t need to modify the registry to enjoy the convenience of double-click execution, scheduled task execution, and automatic execution of Clojure scripts at startup. 

clj-runner.exe uses Go development, what it does is very simple, **read the command from the first line of the Clojure script, and then execute it**, so *just add a command similar to the following to the head of the Clojure script to execute - need to expose the current CWD for lookup directory, add th*e dependencies required by the script, and run the required functions:

clj-runner.exe work well with babashka, if `#!/usr/bin/env bb` is detected at the beginning of the file, then the `bb xxx.clj` file will be executed directly to take advantage of SCI and GraalVM's SVM for the fastest possible script execution, On the other hand, if the file detected at the beginning is `; clojure -Sdeps .. -M -m xxx.clj` or `; bb clojure -Sdeps .. -M -m xxx.clj`, it will be handed over to Shell for execution.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bb
; clojure -Sdeps '{:paths ["".""] :deps {clj-file-zip/clj-file-zip {:mvn/version,""0.1.0""}}}' -M -m auto-backup
; bb clojure -Sdeps '{:paths ["".""] :deps {clj-file-zip/clj-file-zip {:mvn/version,""0.1.0""}}}' -M -m auto-backup
```

Note. if use `#!/usr/bin/env bb`, then will run `bb xxx.clj`, so you may need run -main like script with that:

```clojure
(defn -main []
  (println "running script files-metadata-upload...")
  (let [files (collect-files)]
    (println (send-request! files))))

(when (= "SCI" (-> *clojure-version* :qualifier))
  (-main))
```
